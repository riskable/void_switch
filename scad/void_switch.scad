// Uncomment this to see the precise location of the hall effect sensor in relation to the center of the switch:
//translate([-3.25,-3.25,0]) // Center of sensor is 3.25mm (45Â° angle) from center of switch
//    color("green") cylinder(d=1, h=100, center=true);
// NOTE: The magnet isn't perfectly aligned with the sensor on purpose: It's to cram everything into a slightly tigher space :)

// TODO: Make the body stem-specific like the sheath so that we can get accurate center positions for the sheath.

/*
  NOTES:
    * EXPERIMENT!  Try all sorts of different configurations to find what you like and share your results!
    * The body, sheath, and stem can be printed with 0.28mm layer height (including first layer) with a 0.4mm nozzle.  No need to go smaller (I haven't tested anything bigger).  Experiment!  See what works best with your printer!
    * So far the best results (smoothest switches) have come from printing the body, sheath, and stem in PETG.  However, PLA seems to work fine as well as Nylon (I tested Taulman Bridge).  If you want a *really quiet* switch print the stem in PCTPE or print just the top part (that holds the magnet) in something like TPU (as in, do a "color change" to TPU past the tallest point of the stem's main cylinder).
    * Lubricate your stems with something like Super Lube (any dielectric grease would be fine though) for the best experience.  YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO SAND ANYTHING (unless your printer's tolerances are off).  NOTE: Sanding doesn't seem to make the switch "scratchy" (which surprised me).  You'd *think* it would but it doesn't...  Not with PETG anyway.
    * Printing everything in clear PETG is highly recommended if you plan to have an LED underneath!
    * You can calculate the theoretical force of the your switch using this calculator: https://www.kjmagnetics.com/calculator.asp (use MAGNET_WALL_THICKNESS + MAGNET_VOID as the "distance").
    * For convenience purposes this .scad will output it's best guess as to the force of your switch in the console but it only "knows" about the most common magnet strengths/sizes (e.g. N35_4x2).  See the supported constants at the bottom of utils.scad.
    * THERE ARE A LOT OF PARAMETERS BUT THEY ARE WORTH UNDERSTANDING!  Turns out that there's a lot things that are worthy of being specific about in order to generate *your* perfect key switch.
    * IF YOU INTEND TO USE REED SWITCHES READ THIS: Reed switches seem to activate/connect when a 3x1.5mm magnet (flat side) gets within ~5mm of (one side of) the reed switch.  This script will echo() the resting distance of the BOTTOM SIDE of the magnet indicating how far away it is from the TOP of the keyboard plate.  So if your key plate is 1.25mm thick and your SHEATH_LENGTH is 1.8 the magnet will be resting 3.15mm beneath the underside of your keyboard plate (4.4mm below the top of the switch--ignoring COVER_THICKNESS).  Doing the math...  That means if you want your switch to actuate at 2mm travel you want the metal lead sticking out one side of your reed switch to be ~9.4mm below the top of your keyboard plate (directly beneath where the magnet sits in the stem).
    * There are ways to put the reed switch closer!  It's just harder to figure out: You have to position the metal lead (of one side of) the reed switch so that the magnetic flux hits it at the point you want.  I've found that if you place the reed switch centered directly under the walls of the switch body (in alignment with the walls) that seems to work out to a ~2mm actuation in a switch with a 1.8mm SHEATH_LENGTH.
    2.4mm sheath means magnet is 5mm away from plate in resting position
    1.8mm sheath means magnet is 4.4mm away
    0mm sheath means magnet is 2.6mm away

// IMPORTANT VARIABLES (customize to your liking):

// The amount of space interposed between the magnets. Controls how strong the switch will be; The higher the value the less force will be required to press the switch. Look at the console output to see the calculated switch strength (e.g. "NOTE: ESTIMATED STRENGTH/FORCE: ~56g"). Highly dependent on the strength and thickness of your magnets.
MAGNET_VOID = 0.6; // [0.1:0.1:3]
/* MAGNET_VOID NOTES:
    * The higher the MAGNET_VOID the lower the (initial) force to move (press) the switch.
    * You're just going to have to experiment with a few different values here to see what you like.

// 2-4mm of travel is traditional for mechanical key switches
TOTAL_TRAVEL = 4; // [1:0.1:20]
// How much extra space (up/down) will be used to contain the stem (does not impact TOTAL_TRAVEL).  Longer == less wobble BUT the switch will be taller.  Doesn't really impact the feel of the switch otherwise.
SHEATH_LENGTH = 0.3; // [0:0.1:2]
// Wiggle room inside the sheath for the stem. If your stem doesn't effortlessly slide inside the sheath you need to increase the tolerance or check your printing layer height isn't messing with it.
STEM_TOLERANCE = 0.13; // [0.01:0.01:0.3]
//   ^ IMPORTANT!  If the stem doesn't effortlessly slide in and out of the sheath or has far too much back-corner/front-corner wobble double-check that your printing layer height isn't messing with the tolerances: With STEM_WALL_THICKNESS=1.2 the bottom layer of the sheath where it touches the stem is precisely 1.68mm tall.  Your layer height can impact this value considerably which is why a 0.28mm layer height is recommended (for FDM) as this results in that layer being precisely 1.68mm above the bed.
// NOTE: Also remember that YOU CAN ALWAYS SAND THE STEM IF IT'S TOO TIGHT.  As long as you get up to like 600 grit (or higher) your switch should still be nice and smooth (eventually--after some normal use).

PLA and PETG should flex a bit and hold it strongly. For resin you'll probably want to set this to 0 and put some resin in the hole before inserting the magnet to hold it nice and strong.
STEM_MAGNET_DIAMETER_TOLERANCE = -0.1;
// TIP FOR RESIN PRINTERS: Set STEM_MAGNET_DIAMETER_TOLERANCE to 0 or 0.05 to avoid cracking and and squirt some resin in there before inserting the magnet for a strong hold.

Otherwise its height will be calculated based on the length of the sheath.  AT LEAST 6 IS RECOMMENDED (so the clips will work).

// "cherry_cross" is presently the only supported stem type (more stem options in the future, probably)

STEM_TOP_LENGTH = 4; // [2:0.1:4]
// TIP: If making a low-profile keycap you migth want to reduce STEM_TOP_LENGTH a bit to save some vertical space.  Example: Low-profile Cherry MX style keycaps have ~3mm of room inside (I think) so you can set this to 3 if using keycaps like that.
// In switch_body() it divides, BODY_WIDTH/BODY_TAPER to figure out how much smaller the bottom should be in relation to the top.  If you set this too large you can end up with walls that are too thin.  Also know that you don't *need* any taper at all... It just makes it easier to insert the switch into it's respective hole in your keyboard/switch plate.  Set it to 1 to disable tapering of the switch_body() (and just push it harder!).
BODY_TAPER = 1.1;
// How thick the walls of the sheath will be (the part the stem slides inside of)

SHEATH_MAGNET_DIAMETER_TOLERANCE = 0.1;
// TIP FOR RESIN PRINTERS: Resin tends to be brittle so to prevent cracking when inserting the magnet you may want to set SHEATH_MAGNET_DIAMETER_TOLERANCE to something like 0.1 and squirt some resin on the magnet after insertion to hold it in place.
// How much the sheath lip sticks out on top of the switch body
SHEATH_LIP_OVERHANG = 1;
// Controls the "spread" of the notches >< on the (inside) sides of the sheath (they're rotated this many degrees so they get farther apart as the stem progresses down the length of the sheath; this is to ensure the least amount of friction when returning to keyup).  IF YOU INCREASE TRAVEL SIGNIFICANTLY YOU MAY WANT TO ADJUST THIS but otherwise probably leave it alone.
SHEATH_NOTCH_ANGLE = 1;
// NOTE: Set SHEATH_NOTCH_ANGLE to 0 to have perfectly straight notches >< (not recommended).  If you do this you'll need to be more careful with your STEM_TOLERANCE setting.
// How thick the little wall at the end of the sheath will be.  By default there's no wall/end stop which means that the stem can be easily removed but will also smack into whatever's underneath the switch when you press it (e.g. the sensor or LED on the PCB or the case covering those things).  If you set this to something like 0.8 you'll get a wall of sorts that prevents the stem from coming out (like, ever haha) and will also prevent it from hitting anything below the switch.  It makes it so you can press pretty hard on keycaps (to insert them) without having to worry that your brute strength will break your LEDs/sensors.  NOTE: This feature requires some flex in the plastic body of the sheath in order for the stem to snap into its channel so resin users be forewarned.
SHEATH_END_STOP_THICKNESS = 0.0; // [0.0:0.1:1.2]
// NOTE: If your keyboard has something underneath the switch at the correct TOTAL_TRAVEL distance you don't need the end stopper and can set SHEATH_END_STOP_THICKNESS to 0.  If you *do* want a stopper a value of 0.5 is usually good for a 0.4mm nozzle.
// These SHEATH_CLIP_* parameters control the little clips on the sheath that let it snap-fit into the body (probably leave these alone unless you're working with something other than PLA/PETG that's either much softer or much more brittle)...
// Controls the thickness of the clips on the side of the sheath (i.e. how much they stick out)
SHEATH_CLIP_HEIGHT = 0.5;
// Controls how long the clips on the side of the sheath will be (should only ever need to be adjusted if you make sigificant changes to SHEATH_WALL_THICKNESS)
